Project Title:

Customer Segmentation and Churn Analysis Using Power BI

Objective:

Analyze customer data to identify key segments, understand churn patterns, and provide actionable insights through advanced data exploration and dynamic dashboards in Power BI.

Skills You’ll Learn:

	1.	Data Collection & Preprocessing: Prepare and clean datasets for analysis.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights through statistical summaries and visualizations.
	3.	Customer Segmentation: Identify distinct customer groups using data analysis techniques.
	4.	Churn Analysis: Uncover patterns and factors driving customer churn.
	5.	Data Visualization: Build interactive dashboards in Power BI to present findings.
	6.	Business Insights: Translate data insights into actionable recommendations.

Dataset:

Use a publicly available dataset, such as:

	•	Telco Customer Churn Dataset
	•	UCI Machine Learning Repository Customer Data

The dataset should include customer demographics, usage patterns, subscription details, and churn status.

Project Steps:

1. Data Collection and Integration

	•	Collect customer data from multiple sources (e.g., transactional data, demographics, and customer feedback).
	•	Combine datasets to create a unified database for analysis.
	•	Load the data into Power BI for a quick overview of metrics like total customers, revenue, and churn rate.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

	•	Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats in the dataset.
	•	Perform feature engineering to create new columns such as:
	•	Customer Tenure: Time spent with the company.******
	•	Average Monthly Spend: Revenue per customer.****
	•	Usage Behavior: Frequency of service usage.*****
	•	Export the cleaned data for Power BI visualizations.     

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

	•	Use statistical techniques to understand the distribution of key variables.
	•	Identify patterns and trends in churn rates, customer behavior, and demographics.
	•	Conduct univariate and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between variables.
	•	Visualize findings in Power BI, including:
	•	Churn trends over time.
	•	Revenue contribution by customer segments.
	•	Customer behavior patterns by geography or demographics.

4. Customer Segmentation

	•	Group customers based on shared characteristics such as demographics, subscription plans, and spending patterns.
	•	Define segments (e.g., “High-Spending Loyal Customers,” “At-Risk Customers”).
	•	Use clustering or grouping techniques in Power BI or Python to categorize customers visually.
	•	Display segmentation insights through charts, graphs, and slicers in Power BI.

5. Churn Analysis

	•	Investigate factors contributing to churn by analyzing patterns in customer data:
	•	Identify common traits among customers who churned (e.g., low usage, high complaints).
	•	Visualize churn rates across customer segments or geographies.
	•	Highlight actionable insights, such as regions with the highest churn or segments that need retention efforts.
	•	Use Power BI to create dynamic visualizations that explore churn-related trends interactively.

6. Advanced Power BI Dashboards

Create an Interactive Power BI Dashboard with the following elements:

	1.	KPIs:
	•	Total Customers.-------
	•	Average Monthly Revenue per Customer.---
	•	Churn Rate.--------
	2.	Customer Segmentation Analysis:
	•	Segment-wise revenue contribution.
	•	Churn trends by customer group.
	3.	Churn Analysis:
	•	Visualize churn patterns using heatmaps, bar charts, and filters.
	•	Interactive filters for segment-specific or region-specific churn trends.
	4.	Geo Analysis:
	•	Map visualizations showing customer distribution and churn rates by region.
	5.	Drill-throughs:
	•	Allow stakeholders to dive into detailed insights for specific customer groups or geographies.

7. Explainability and Recommendations

	•	Provide a summary of key findings, such as:
	•	High-churn customer segments.
	•	Low-performing regions.
	•	Characteristics of high-value customers.
	•	Translate findings into actionable recommendations:
	•	Implement retention campaigns for high-risk customers.
	•	Focus marketing on high-value segments.
	•	Improve services in regions with high churn.

8. Final Report and Presentation

	•	Develop a professional Power BI dashboard for presenting insights to stakeholders.
	•	Prepare a report summarizing the analysis, including
